### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was about designing a system for a client who needed a platform to manage driving lessons and appointments. They wanted something easy for students to book lessons, track progress, and access resources.

### What did you do particularly well?

I think I did well in gathering and documenting requirements. I made sure everything was clear with the client, so there was no confusion. This helped set up a solid foundation for the design.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could revise something, it’d be the UI section in the system design doc. I’d add more detailed wireframes and screen descriptions to make the design clearer, especially for non-technical people.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I took the user’s needs and broke them down into features like scheduling, notifications, and progress tracking. Keeping user needs in mind is essential; if the system doesn’t actually solve their problems, it’s not effective.

### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I usually start with requirements, then plan out components and how they interact. In the future, I’d use more UML diagrams and try to get user feedback early on to make sure the design is solid and user-friendly.
